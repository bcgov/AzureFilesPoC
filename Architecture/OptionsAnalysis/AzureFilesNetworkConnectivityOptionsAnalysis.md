# Azure Files Network Connectivity Options Analysis

## Overview: Private Endpoints & Azure Files
Private Endpoints for Azure Files map private IPs from your VNet to the Azure Storage account.

This ensures traffic stays within your private network—no public IPs involved.

Access is only possible from:
- Within the same VNet
- Peered VNets
- On-premises networks connected via ExpressRoute or VPN

## POC Approaches for Azure Files Access

### Approach 1: VPN + Private Endpoint (Current Setup)
Users connect via VPN to access Azure Files through a private endpoint.

**Pros:** Already in place, secure, no major changes needed.
**Cons:** Requires VPN client; not seamless if VPN disconnects.

### Approach 2: ExpressRoute + Private Endpoint
Once ExpressRoute is ready, users can access Azure Files without VPN.

**Pros:** Seamless, high-performance, private routing.
**Cons:** Requires ExpressRoute setup and routing configuration.

### Approach 3: Azure File Sync (Hybrid Model)
Keep using your on-prem file server, but sync it with Azure Files.

Great for:
- Branch office caching
- Cloud backup
- Gradual migration to cloud

**Pros:** No user disruption, hybrid flexibility.
**Cons:** Requires agent installation, server management, additional overhead and duplication of storage costs.

### Approach 4: Web App + App Gateway / Azure Front Door
Expose file access via a web interface behind a secure ingress layer.

Not feasible for SMB/NFS file access.
Only suitable for HTTP-based apps, not traditional file shares.

## Option Analysis

### Option 1: Do PoC with VPN + Private Endpoint (Short-Term), Then Transition to ExpressRoute
Since all users already use VPN, this is the simplest and most secure method to start with.

**Short-Term (VPN):**
- Users access Azure Files via VPN and private endpoint.
- No major changes needed to begin the PoC.

Ensure:
- Private DNS resolution is working (e.g., privatelink.file.core.windows.net)
- Firewall/NSG/UDR rules allow SMB (port 445) to the storage account's private IP
- Storage account network rules only allow traffic from your VNet

**Long-Term (ExpressRoute):**
- Transition to ExpressRoute once available for seamless access without VPN (e.g., from office).

Configure:
- Private peering
- Routing from on-prem to Azure Files via ExpressRoute
- DNS forwarding or conditional forwarding to Azure Private DNS zones

### Option 2: Wait to Begin PoC Until ExpressRoute Is Available
Delay the PoC until ExpressRoute is fully provisioned and configured.

Ensures a seamless, high-performance experience from the start.
May postpone testing and early feedback.

### Option 3: Use Azure File Sync for Hybrid Access
Proceed with a PoC using Azure File Sync on your on-prem file server.

Benefits:
- Branch office caching
- Cloud backup
- Gradual migration to Azure Files

Considerations:
- Requires agent installation and server management
- Adds some storage cost overhead due to duplication
- Still benefits from private endpoint security

## Key Considerations

### Private Endpoints
Make sure your network is set up so that devices can reach the private IP address of the Azure Storage account.

This includes configuring DNS and routing correctly.

### Firewall and Network Rules
Make sure your network settings don’t block access to the storage account.

This includes checking any security rules or custom routes that might prevent traffic from reaching the storage account’s private IP.

Additional detail:
- NSG (Network Security Group): Controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet or network interface level.
- UDR (User-Defined Route): Custom routing rules that can override default Azure routing.

These should allow traffic on port 445 (for SMB) or the appropriate port for NFS.

### DNS Resolution
Use Azure Private DNS Zones (e.g., privatelink.file.core.windows.net) linked to your virtual network.

Or configure on-prem DNS to forward requests for Azure private endpoints to Azure DNS.

### Routing
Ensure that traffic from your on-prem network to Azure Files is routed correctly—either through VPN or ExpressRoute.

Once ExpressRoute is available, make sure private peering and routing tables are updated accordingly.

## Access Requirements for Azure Files via Private Endpoint
To ensure successful access to Azure Files over a private endpoint, make sure the following are allowed in your firewall or security settings:

### Port Access
TCP Port 445 must be open for SMB access (or the appropriate port for NFS if used).

### IP Addresses
Allow access to the private IP address assigned to the Azure Files private endpoint in your VNet.

### DNS Zones
Ensure DNS resolution for:
- privatelink.file.core.windows.net

This is typically handled using an Azure Private DNS Zone linked to your VNet.

If accessing from on-prem, configure DNS conditional forwarding to Azure.

### Storage Account Network Rules
In the Azure portal, under your storage account’s Networking settings:
- Set to Selected networks
- Add your VNet to the allowed list
- Optionally enable “Allow trusted Microsoft services” if needed
