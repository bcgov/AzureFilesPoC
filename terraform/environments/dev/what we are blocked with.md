# Project Status Summary: Azure Files Deployment via Self-Hosted Runner

## 1. The Goal
The primary objective is to deploy a **private Azure Files share** and its dependencies (Storage Account, Networking) into the BC Government Azure environment using a secure CI/CD pipeline. The infrastructure is defined in Terraform and deployed via GitHub Actions.

## 2. What is Working (âœ… SUCCESS)
- **Foundational CI/CD infrastructure** is built and validated to BC Government security standards.
- **Self-Hosted Runner Deployed:**
  - Linux VM is running inside the private Azure VNet.
- **Secure Access Confirmed:**
  - Secure access to the runner VM via Azure Bastion and SSH keys.
- **Runner is Operational:**
  - GitHub Actions runner agent is installed, configured, and registered with the `bcgov/AzureFilesPoC` repository.
- **Test Workflows:**
  - Simple test workflows confirm the runner can execute jobs successfully.

> This proves a secure, policy-compliant automation path into the Azure environment exists.

## 3. The Current Roadblock
Despite having a working private runner, the main Terraform deployment is **failing at the apply step**.

- **What's Blocked:** Creation of the `azurerm_storage_account` resource.
- **The Specific Error:**

```text
Error: creating Storage Account ... RequestDisallowedByPolicy: Resource 'stagpssgazurepocdev01' was disallowed by policy. Reasons: 'A policy is in place to prevent public IP addresses on the target Azure PaaS service(s).'.
```

## 4. The Troubleshooting Journey (What We Tried)
- **RBAC Permissions:** Confirmed the Service Principal has all necessary roles (Network Contributor, Storage Account Contributor). Not a permissions issue.
- **Terraform Validation Errors:** Fixed provider versions, duplicate variables, incorrect arguments. Code is now syntactically correct.
- **Platform-Managed DNS:** Removed Private DNS Zone management logic per documentation.
- **Advanced Terraform Patterns:** Explored moving the private endpoint inside the storage account module (not required).

## 5. The Definitive Diagnosis (The True Root Cause)
After re-evaluating the error and BC Gov documentation, the root cause was identified:

- The original `terraform/modules/storage/account/main.tf` contained **both**:
  - `public_network_access_enabled = false`
  - a `network_rules { ... }` block
- The presence of the `network_rules` block is interpreted by policy as an attempt to configure a public IP feature, which is **blocked**.

## 6. The Final Solution (Implemented & Ready for Testing)
- **All Terraform files have been updated for policy compliance:**
  - The `storage/account` module now creates a storage account with `public_network_access_enabled = false` and **no** `network_rules` block.
  - The `dev/main.tf` file uses the standard pattern: calls the fixed `poc_storage_account` module first, then a separate `storage_private_endpoint` module.
- **Expected Result:**
  - This sequence will now work because the storage account creation is no longer blocked by policy.

## Next Step
- Commit the latest code changes and re-run the GitHub Actions pipeline.
- This run is expected to succeed.
