# Project Status Summary: Azure Files Deployment via Self-Hosted Runner

---
## ðŸš© Big Change Update (July 5, 2025)
**All major roadblocks are now resolved.**
- The pipeline can now deploy a private, policy-compliant Azure Files share and all dependencies (Storage Account, Networking, Private Endpoint, RBAC) in the BC Gov Azure environment, both locally and via CI/CD.
- File share creation is fully automated and unblocked. No errors or policy issues remain.
- The previous role assignment duplication issue has been fixed; only one assignment exists at the storage account level.
- All outputs are as expected, and the infrastructure is policy-compliant.

## 1. The Goal
The primary objective is to deploy a **private Azure Files share** and its dependencies (Storage Account, Networking) into the BC Government Azure environment using a secure CI/CD pipeline. The infrastructure is defined in Terraform and deployed via GitHub Actions.

## 2. What is Working (âœ… SUCCESS)
- **Foundational CI/CD infrastructure** is built and validated to BC Government security standards.
- **Self-Hosted Runner Deployed:**
  - Linux VM is running inside the private Azure VNet.
- **Secure Access Confirmed:**
  - Secure access to the runner VM via Azure Bastion and SSH keys.
- **Runner is Operational:**
  - GitHub Actions runner agent is installed, configured, and registered with the `bcgov/AzureFilesPoC` repository.
- **Test Workflows:**
  - Simple test workflows confirm the runner can execute jobs successfully.
- **NSG Creation via Pipeline:**
  - Confirmed that the pipeline can successfully deploy a Network Security Group (NSG) resource using the self-hosted runner and Terraform. This proves the runner, permissions, and pipeline are working for at least some Azure resources.
- **Service Principal Permissions:**
  - Confirmed the service principal (`[REDACTED_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_OBJECT_ID]`) has the required roles (`Storage Account Contributor`, `Network Contributor`, and a custom role) on the resource group. RBAC permissions are not the issue.
- **Storage Account & Private Endpoint Creation (Local & github CI/CD):**
  - Successfully created a policy-compliant storage account and private endpoint using `terraform apply` run both locally on the self-hosted runner **and** in the GitHub Actions workflow. No policy errors encountered. The following settings were critical:
    - `public_network_access_enabled = false`
    - No `network_rules` block present
    - (For future blob use: `allow_blob_public_access = false` should be set, but not required for Azure Files only)
  - Outputs confirmed storage account and private endpoint were provisioned as expected in both environments.
- **Data Plane Role Assignment & Propagation Wait (github CI/CD):**
  - Successfully assigned the "Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor" role to the service principal for the storage account and waited for propagation using a `time_sleep` resource. This enables automated file share creation in the pipeline.
  - Verified in GitHub Actions workflow with `terraform apply` that both resources were created and outputs were as expected.
- **Blob Data Plane Role Assignment (Local & CI/CD):**
  - Successfully assigned the "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role to the service principal for the storage account and waited for propagation using a `time_sleep` resource. This enables automated blob container creation in the pipeline.
  - Verified in GitHub Actions workflow with `terraform apply` that both resources were created and outputs were as expected.
- **File Share Creation (Local & CI/CD):**
  - The file share module is now enabled and working. No errors or policy issues remain. The previous duplicate role assignment error is resolved.

> This proves a secure, policy-compliant automation path into the Azure environment exists, and that the pipeline can deploy networking, storage, and data plane permissions (including for blob and file shares) both locally and via CI/CD.

## 3. The Current Roadblock
**None.** All previously blocking issues (policy, RBAC, file share, and blob data plane role assignment) are now resolved. The deployment is fully automated and policy-compliant.

## 4. Troubleshooting Journey (Historical)
- **RBAC Permissions:** Confirmed the Service Principal has all necessary roles (Network Contributor, Storage Account Contributor). Not a permissions issue.
- **Terraform Validation Errors:** Fixed provider versions, duplicate variables, incorrect arguments. Code is now syntactically correct.
- **Platform-Managed DNS:** Removed Private DNS Zone management logic per documentation.
- **Advanced Terraform Patterns:** Explored moving the private endpoint inside the storage account module (not required).
- **Isolation Test:** Successfully deployed only the NSG to confirm the runner and pipeline are working for resource creation.
- **Iterative Testing:** Repeatedly tested storage account creation with minimal settings until policy was satisfied.
- **Role Assignment Error:** Duplicate role assignment for file share was removed; now only assigned at the storage account level.

## 5. The Final Solution (Tested & Working Locally and in CI/CD)
- **All Terraform files have been updated for policy compliance:**
  - The `storage/account` module now creates a storage account with `public_network_access_enabled = false` and **no** `network_rules` block.
  - The `dev/main.tf` file uses the standard pattern: calls the fixed `poc_storage_account` module first, then a separate `storage_private_endpoint` module.
  - The file share module is enabled and working, with no duplicate role assignment.
- **Result:**
  - `terraform apply` on the self-hosted runner and in the GitHub Actions workflow both successfully created the storage account, private endpoint, and file share with no policy errors.

## Next Steps
- **Expand Automation:**
  - Enable and test additional modules (blob, monitoring, management policies, etc.) as needed.
  - Update documentation and status blocks as new resources are verified in CI/CD.
- **Refactor/Cleanup:**
  - Refactor code for clarity and maintainability as the project grows.
- **Monitor for Issues:**
  - If issues arise in CI/CD, compare runner environment, permissions, and provider versions with local setup.
