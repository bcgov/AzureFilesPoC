# Project Status Summary: Azure Files Deployment via Self-Hosted Runner

## 1. The Goal
The primary objective is to deploy a **private Azure Files share** and its dependencies (Storage Account, Networking) into the BC Government Azure environment using a secure CI/CD pipeline. The infrastructure is defined in Terraform and deployed via GitHub Actions.

## 2. What is Working (âœ… SUCCESS)
- **Foundational CI/CD infrastructure** is built and validated to BC Government security standards.
- **Self-Hosted Runner Deployed:**
  - Linux VM is running inside the private Azure VNet.
- **Secure Access Confirmed:**
  - Secure access to the runner VM via Azure Bastion and SSH keys.
- **Runner is Operational:**
  - GitHub Actions runner agent is installed, configured, and registered with the `bcgov/AzureFilesPoC` repository.
- **Test Workflows:**
  - Simple test workflows confirm the runner can execute jobs successfully.
- **NSG Creation via Pipeline:**
  - Confirmed that the pipeline can successfully deploy a Network Security Group (NSG) resource using the self-hosted runner and Terraform. This proves the runner, permissions, and pipeline are working for at least some Azure resources.
- **Service Principal Permissions:**
  - Confirmed the service principal (`[REDACTED_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_OBJECT_ID]`) has the required roles (`Storage Account Contributor`, `Network Contributor`, and a custom role) on the resource group. RBAC permissions are not the issue.
- **Storage Account & Private Endpoint Creation (Local & github CI/CD):**
  - Successfully created a policy-compliant storage account and private endpoint using `terraform apply` run both locally on the self-hosted runner **and** in the GitHub Actions workflow. No policy errors encountered. The following settings were critical:
    - `public_network_access_enabled = false`
    - No `network_rules` block present
    - (For future blob use: `allow_blob_public_access = false` should be set, but not required for Azure Files only)
  - Outputs confirmed storage account and private endpoint were provisioned as expected in both environments.
- **Data Plane Role Assignment & Propagation Wait (github CI/CD):**
  - Successfully assigned the "Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor" role to the service principal for the storage account and waited for propagation using a `time_sleep` resource. This enables automated file share creation in the pipeline.
  - Verified in GitHub Actions workflow with `terraform apply` that both resources were created and outputs were as expected.

> This proves a secure, policy-compliant automation path into the Azure environment exists, and that the pipeline can deploy networking, storage, and data plane permissions both locally and via CI/CD.

## 3. The Current Roadblock (RESOLVED LOCALLY & IN CI/CD)
The main Terraform deployment was previously **failing at the apply step** for the storage account due to a BC Gov policy block. This has now been resolved for both local and CI/CD runs:

- **What's Blocked (Previously):** Creation of the `azurerm_storage_account` resource.
- **The Specific Error (Previously):**

```text
Error: creating Storage Account ... RequestDisallowedByPolicy: Resource 'stagpssgazurepocdev01' was disallowed by policy. Reasons: 'A policy is in place to prevent public IP addresses on the target Azure PaaS service(s).'.
```

- **Root Cause:**
  - The storage account resource was missing the explicit setting for blob public access (`allow_blob_public_access = false`) and/or had a `network_rules` block, both of which triggered the policy block.
- **Solution:**
  - Updated the storage account module to remove the `network_rules` block and ensure `public_network_access_enabled = false` is set. For Azure Files only, `allow_blob_public_access` is not required, but should be added if blob containers are used in the future.

## 4. The Troubleshooting Journey (What We Tried)
- **RBAC Permissions:** Confirmed the Service Principal has all necessary roles (Network Contributor, Storage Account Contributor). Not a permissions issue.
- **Terraform Validation Errors:** Fixed provider versions, duplicate variables, incorrect arguments. Code is now syntactically correct.
- **Platform-Managed DNS:** Removed Private DNS Zone management logic per documentation.
- **Advanced Terraform Patterns:** Explored moving the private endpoint inside the storage account module (not required).
- **Isolation Test:** Successfully deployed only the NSG to confirm the runner and pipeline are working for resource creation.
- **Iterative Testing:** Repeatedly tested storage account creation with minimal settings until policy was satisfied.

## 5. The Definitive Diagnosis (The True Root Cause)
After re-evaluating the error and BC Gov documentation, the root cause was identified:

- The original `terraform/modules/storage/account/main.tf` contained **both**:
  - `public_network_access_enabled = false`
  - a `network_rules { ... }` block
- The presence of the `network_rules` block is interpreted by policy as an attempt to configure a public IP feature, which is **blocked**.
- Additionally, the policy checks for `allowBlobPublicAccess = false` for blob storage. For Azure Files only, this is not required, but should be set if blob containers are added in the future.

## 6. The Final Solution (Tested & Working Locally and in CI/CD)
- **All Terraform files have been updated for policy compliance:**
  - The `storage/account` module now creates a storage account with `public_network_access_enabled = false` and **no** `network_rules` block.
  - The `dev/main.tf` file uses the standard pattern: calls the fixed `poc_storage_account` module first, then a separate `storage_private_endpoint` module.
- **Result:**
  - `terraform apply` on the self-hosted runner and in the GitHub Actions workflow both successfully created the storage account and private endpoint with no policy errors.

## Next Steps
- **Enable File Share Creation:**
  - Uncomment and test the file share module to provision Azure Files shares.
- **Continue Automation:**
  - Expand automation to include monitoring, management policies, and other required resources.
- **If issues arise in CI/CD:**
  - Compare runner environment, permissions, and provider versions with local setup.
