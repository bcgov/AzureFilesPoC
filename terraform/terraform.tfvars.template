# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and fill in your real values
# Do NOT include secrets or sensitive values here

# Variables for Azure Files PoC Terraform Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
# This file only assigns values to variables defined in variables.tf
# No Azure resources are created just by having this file
# Resources are only created when you explicitly run 'terraform apply' (which we haven't done)
#
# ‚ùó CRITICAL RULE: make sure that you don't put real values in this file
#                  use this template and copy as terraform.tfvars that is part of .gitignore
#                  populate with values contained in .env/azure_full_inventory.json
#                  that is populated by running OneTimeActivities/GetAzureExistingResources/unix/azure_full_inventory.sh


# Names in this file now directly match variables.tf
