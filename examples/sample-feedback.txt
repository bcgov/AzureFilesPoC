Customer Feedback Collection - BC Services Card Application

Feedback #1:
"The new online renewal process is so much easier than going to an ICBC office! 
I completed everything in about 10 minutes from my phone. Great improvement!"

Feedback #2:
"I'm frustrated that the system logged me out three times while I was trying to 
upload my photo. Had to start over each time. Please fix the session timeout!"

Feedback #3:
"The instructions were clear but I wish there was a progress bar showing how many 
steps were left. Otherwise, decent experience."

Feedback #4:
"Absolutely terrible. The website crashed right when I was about to submit my 
application after spending 30 minutes filling everything out. Lost all my data. 
Very disappointed in this government service."

Feedback #5:
"Quick and efficient. The ID verification with my phone camera worked perfectly. 
Received my new card in just 5 business days. Impressed with the turnaround time!"
