BC Government Digital Services Policy Framework
Version 2.1 - December 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Province of British Columbia is committed to delivering modern, secure, and 
citizen-centric digital services. This policy framework establishes guidelines 
for all ministries and agencies deploying cloud-based solutions within the 
BC Government Azure Landing Zone.

KEY PRINCIPLES

1. Security First
   All cloud deployments must adhere to zero-trust networking principles. 
   Public endpoints are prohibited for sensitive workloads. Private endpoints 
   and managed identities must be used for all Azure PaaS services.

2. Data Residency
   All data classified as Protected B or higher must remain within Canadian 
   data centers. The primary regions for BC Government workloads are 
   Canada Central (Toronto) and Canada East (Quebec City).

3. Cost Optimization
   Ministries must implement auto-shutdown policies for non-production 
   virtual machines. Reserved instances should be used for predictable 
   workloads exceeding 12 months.

4. Identity and Access Management
   Azure Active Directory integration is mandatory. All service accounts 
   must use managed identities where possible. API keys must be stored 
   in Azure Key Vault with appropriate RBAC.

5. Monitoring and Compliance
   All resources must send diagnostic logs to the central Log Analytics 
   Workspace. Azure Policy will enforce compliance with guardrails 
   automatically.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

Landing Zone Architecture:
- Hub-spoke network topology with centralized firewall
- ExpressRoute connectivity to on-premises data centers
- Private DNS zones for Azure service resolution
- Network Security Groups on all subnets

AI and Machine Learning Workloads:
- Azure AI Foundry for ML model development and deployment
- Private endpoints required for Cognitive Services
- Model inference must occur within the landing zone boundary
- Data used for training must be classified and handled appropriately

COMPLIANCE TIMELINE

Phase 1 (Q1 2025): All new deployments must comply
Phase 2 (Q2 2025): Existing workloads begin migration
Phase 3 (Q4 2025): Full compliance required
