# Questions for Azure Admin: Troubleshooting VM Connectivity

## Summary of Progress

### What worked

#### Core infrastructure
- **CI/CD resource group** (`rg-ag-pssg-cicd-tools-dev`) is present and referenced in Terraform.
- **Runner subnet** (`snet-agithub-runners`) is created and associated with the correct NSG.
- **Network Security Group (NSG)** (`nsg-github-runners`) is correctly associated with both the subnet and NIC, and has an inbound SSH rule for my VPN IP.
- **NSG association** for the runner subnet is enforced and managed by Terraform.
- **Data sources for VNet, subnet, and NSG** are correctly referenced in Terraform for idempotency and drift correction.
- **Terraform backend** is configured for remote state management.

#### Compute and access
- Successfully deployed VM (`vm-ag-pssg-azure-poc-dev-01`) in the correct subnet (`snet-agithub-runners`) of VNet (`d5007d-dev-vwan-spoke`).
- My SSH key and username are correctly configured on the VM.
- VPN connection (Cisco AnyConnect) is established and assigns an IP in the expected range.

#### Security and automation
- **RBAC assignment**: GitHub Actions service principal has Network Contributor rights on the CI/CD resource group.
- **Bastion module and NSG association** are defined in Terraform (deployment blocked by policy, but configuration is present).

### What Didn't Work:
- Unable to connect to the VM via SSH or ping from my workstation (timeouts).
- VPN connectivity to the spoke VNet and/or VM is not working as expected (possible routing, ExpressRoute, or firewall configuration issue).
- ExpressRoute is present, but access from VPN to the spoke VNet/VM is not working—need help configuring ExpressRoute or related network rules to allow this access.
- Unable to deploy Azure Bastion (via Terraform or manually) due to NSG compliance and policy restrictions.
- Unable to complete self-hosted GitHub Actions runner setup due to lack of connectivity and Bastion access.
- 

## Background
I am unable to connect to my Azure VM (`vm-ag-pssg-azure-poc-dev-01`, private IP: `10.46.73.20`) via SSH from my workstation, even though:
- The VM is running in the subnet `snet-agithub-runners` of VNet `d5007d-dev-vwan-spoke`.
- The NSG (`nsg-github-runners`) is associated with the subnet and NIC, and has an inbound rule allowing SSH (TCP/22) from my VPN-assigned IP (`142.35.168.157/32`).
- My VPN client is Cisco AnyConnect, and I am connected with the above IP.
- I have verified my SSH key and username are correct.

## Problems Encountered
- SSH to `azureadmin@10.46.73.20` times out: `ssh: connect to host 10.46.73.20 port 22: Operation timed out`
- `ping 10.46.73.20` also times out (no response).
- I have confirmed the VM is running and the private IP is correct.
- No public IP is assigned to the VM.
- I also encountered issues setting up the self-hosted GitHub Actions runner VM due to these connectivity and policy restrictions (e.g., inability to access the VM for registration or troubleshooting, and Bastion deployment being blocked).
- Attempts to deploy Azure Bastion (via Terraform and manually) failed due to NSG compliance errors:
  - Example error: `NetworkSecurityGroupNotCompliantForAzureBastionSubnet` — "Network security group nsg-bastion-vm-ag-pssg-azure-poc-dev-01 does not have necessary rules for Azure Bastion Subnet AzureBastionSubnet."
  - I tried both Terraform and manual creation of the Bastion subnet and NSG, but all attempts failed due to policy or required rule restrictions.

## Questions for Azure/Network Admin

1. **Is routing from my VPN subnet to the Azure VNet (`10.46.73.0/24`) enabled?**
   - Is traffic from my VPN-assigned IP (`142.35.168.157`) or the full VPN subnet allowed to reach the VNet/subnet where my VM resides?
   - Is there a UDR, NVA, or Azure Firewall that could be blocking or not routing this traffic?

2. **Is ExpressRoute or VNet peering configured to allow traffic from the VPN or office network to the spoke VNet?**
   - Are there any restrictions or missing routes that would prevent connectivity?

3. **Are there any additional NSGs, Azure Firewall, or on-premises firewalls blocking inbound SSH (TCP/22) or ICMP (ping) to the VM?**
   - Can you confirm that the only NSG in effect is `nsg-github-runners` and that it is not being overridden or blocked elsewhere?

4. **Is my VPN subnet (or office network subnet) included in the allowed source ranges for the NSG or any other network controls?**
   - If not, what is the full subnet range I should request to be whitelisted for SSH access?

5. **Is split tunneling enabled on the VPN?**
   - Is all traffic destined for `10.46.73.0/24` routed through the VPN, or do I need to be on a specific network or use a different VPN profile?

6. **Is there a way to test connectivity from another VM or resource in the same VNet/subnet to confirm the VM is reachable internally?**
   - Can you run a test from another Azure VM in the same VNet to `10.46.73.20` on port 22?

7. **If all else fails, can you provide temporary Bastion or Just-in-Time (JIT) access for troubleshooting?**
   - If direct SSH is not possible, is there an approved method for secure access (e.g., Azure Bastion, JIT, or a jumpbox)?
   - **Note:** I was also unable to deploy Azure Bastion in this environment due to policy restrictions. If Bastion is the recommended solution, can you assist with its deployment or provide an exception?

## Additional Details
- My SSH public key is already on the VM.
- I am using the username `azureadmin`.
- My VPN client is Cisco AnyConnect.
- My current VPN IP is `142.35.168.157`.

**Please advise on what changes or checks are needed to enable SSH connectivity from my workstation (via VPN or office network) to my Azure VM.**
