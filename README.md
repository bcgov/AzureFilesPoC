# Azure Files Proof of Concept

This repository contains documentation and resources for evaluating Azure Files as a cost-effective, performant, and secure replacement for on-premises file storage infrastructure in a government context.

## Project Overview

The BC Government is exploring Azure Files as a solution to address several challenges with current on-premises file storage:

- **Rising Infrastructure Costs**: Reducing operational expenditures for storage hardware
- **Storage Optimization**: Implementing automated tiering strategies for cost-effective data lifecycle management
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Decreasing technical overhead while maintaining or improving service levels
- **Media File Management**: Better handling of large video/audio files with appropriate archiving capabilities
- **Resource Stewardship**: Demonstrating responsible use of taxpayer resources

## Repository Contents

## Key Evaluation Areas

1. **File Access & Management**: Ensuring compatibility with existing workflows, including folder operations and metadata preservation
2. **Performance & Latency**: Validating speed for large file transfers and real-time playback scenarios
3. **Security & Compliance**: Testing AD integration, permission enforcement, and security controls
4. **Backup & Recovery**: Evaluating snapshot capabilities and integration with Azure Backup
5. **Tiering & Lifecycle Management**: Testing cost optimization through automated movement between storage tiers
6. **Reporting & Monitoring**: Assessing visibility into storage utilization and costs
7. **Cost Analysis**: Developing a framework for comprehensive TCO comparison

## Architecture at a Glance

This PoC implements a hybrid connectivity model with Azure Files accessed via Private Endpoint and optional integration with Azure Blob Storage for tiering:

## Getting Started

Review the [Proof of Concept Plan](ProofOfConceptPlan.md) for an understanding of project objectives and evaluation criteria.

For detailed technical architecture, see the [Architecture Overview](ArchitectureOverview.md).

## Network Connectivity Options

Multiple connectivity approaches are being evaluated, including:
- VPN + Private Endpoint (short-term)
- ExpressRoute + Private Endpoint (long-term)
- Azure File Sync (hybrid model)

Details on these options are available in the [Network Connectivity Options Analysis](AzureFilesNetworkConnectivityOptionsAnalysis.md).
